In order to use WECUI, the following is required to be installed  

**Client** 

***1.18+***  
Pending PR https://github.com/EngineHub/WorldEditCUI/pull/53
 
***1.14+***  
* WECUI (Fabric Version) - [Download](https://github.com/mikroskeem/WorldEditCUI#installation) 

***1.12 and under***  
* Liteloader Vanilla - [Download](http://www.liteloader.com/download)    OR    Liteloader Forge - [Download](http://jenkins.liteloader.com/job/LiteLoader%201.12.2/lastSuccessfulBuild/artifact/build/libs/liteloader-1.12.2-SNAPSHOT-release.jar)

Simply place both WECUI and Fabric API jars into the mods client folder.

If installed correctly, you should be able to see the same visuals as above when you right-click on a claim using a stick.

**Disclaimer:** It's a known issue that Shaders don't get along with this feature due to Optifine having its own rendering pipeline. Shaders are probably even more custom and just plain break certain things. Resource packs, on the other hand, will work fine. Therefore, use at your own risk.
