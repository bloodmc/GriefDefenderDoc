:warning: Before using WorldGuard migrator, backup your data (including LuckPerms).  It is recommended to test migration on a test server before applying to production to ensure everything works as expected.

### GriefDefender supports a migration of cuboid regions from WorldGuard. To migrate to GriefDefender, perform the following steps 

### Current Limitations
* Only supports cuboid regions.
* Does not support regions that cross each other's boundaries.
* Does not support custom flags currently. (Will support in future release)

The following WG flags are currently supported for migration:
```
allowed-cmds
block-break
block-place
block-trampling
blocked-cmds
build
chest-access
chorus-fruit-teleport
creeper-explosion
crop-growth
damage-animals
deny-spawn
enderdragon-block-damage
enderman-grief

mob-damage
mob-spawning
mushroom-growth
other-explosion

```

### The following flags do not support migration but can be handled via GD's API
```
deny-message
entry-deny-message
exit-deny-message
exit-override
notify-enter
notify-exit
```

## Migration Steps
1. Add GriefDefender jar to plugins
2. Remove WorldGuard jar from plugins
3. Start the server at least once to generate GriefDefender configs.
4. Stop server
5. Edit global.conf under ./plugins/GriefDefender/
6. Locate section
```
# Set to true to enable WorldGuard data migrator.
# Note: Only cuboid regions are supported.
# Note: It is recommended to backup data before using.
worldguard=false
```
7. Set worldguard to `true`
8. Start server

If done properly, GriefDefender will migrate each world's data as it loads from `plugins/WorldGuard/data/<worldname>` to `plugins/GriefDefender`.
Migration output should appear in console as it is migrating.
