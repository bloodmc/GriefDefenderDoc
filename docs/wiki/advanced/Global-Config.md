GriefDefender's default config offers extended customization for your server. Below is a breakdown of all default variables for your convenience. 

:::: warning Some options can cause irreparable changes to your data
Please ensure that you have read the sub-text found next to the variables in your generated [global.conf](/wiki/advanced/Global-Config.html) file.  
**All migration variables should ALWAYS be used AFTER a backup of your data is made.**
::::

## Plugin Dependency
Do note, cost variables (such as Towns' `creation-cost`) **require** an Economy plugin (Example: [Vault](https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/34315/), [EssentialsX](https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/9089/)). Similarly, MCClans is only needed if you plan on using it's integration across plugins. It is **not**, however, required to use GriefDefender's Town claims.

For example, adding block-break to the list will translate into `griefdefender.user.flag.block-break` being checked as true, therefore allowing the player to edit his claim's block-break flag with `/cf`, `/cfg`, and `/cfp`. 

## Modular Configuration
GriefDefender allows for modular enabling. As per default configuration files however, all modules are enabled. Disabling a module will render all flags unusable. Only do it if you do not plan on using GriefDefender's management of said flag. You can choose to disable the following: 
* Block-Changes: block-break, block-grow, block-modify, block-place, block-pre, block-spread
* Collisions: collide-block, collide-entity
* Commands: command-execute
* Movements: enter-claim, exit-claim
* Entity: entity-damage, entity-riding, entity-spawn, entity-teleport-from, entity-teleport-to
* Explosions: explosion-block, explosion-entity
* Interacts: interact-block-primary, interact-block-secondary, interact-entity-primary, interact-entity-secondary, interact-inventory, interact-inventory-click, interact-item-primary, interact-item-secondary
* Item: item-drop, item-pickup, item-spawn, item-use, item-damage
* Liquids: liquid-flow
* Portals: portal-use
* Projectiles: projectile-impact-block, projectile-impact-entity

| reset-accrued-claim-blocks | If enabled, resets all playerdata accrued claim blocks to match total cost of claims owned. <br />Example: If a player has 5 basic claims with a total cost of 1000, this will set their accrued claim blocks to 1000. <br />Note: This will also reset all bonus claim blocks to 0. It is highly recommended to backup before using. | FALSE |
