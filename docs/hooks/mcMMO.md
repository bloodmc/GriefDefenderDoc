Manage from `/claimoption` or more information in the dedicated section [Options](/wiki/basic/Options.html)  

## Setup

### Install mcMMO Flag Definition  

* [presets/mcmmo.conf](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/bloodmc/GriefDefenderDefinitions/master/mcMMO/presets/mcmmo.conf)

Right click on the page and select "Save as", save as `mcmmo.conf` in `config/griefdefender/presets`

* [lang/presets/mcmmo/en_US.conf](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/bloodmc/GriefDefenderDefinitions/master/mcMMO/lang/presets/mcmmo/en_US.conf)

Right click on the page and select "Save as", save as `en_US.conf` in `config/griefdefender/lang/presets/mcmmo`    

After doing both, `/gdreload`  

Execute command `/cf` and you should see a new preset named `mcmmo`. Click that to load and configure per claim as needed.  

Note: If you do not see the preset in GUI, make sure the files above end in `.conf`.  

See [Flag Definitions GUI](/wiki/basic/Flag-Definitions-GUI.html) for more info on how to work with presets and default settings for flags.
