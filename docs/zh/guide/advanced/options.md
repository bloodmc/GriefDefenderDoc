选项，也被称为 元数据(Meta), 是一种通过你的权限系统来配置插件的方法，这使你能够为不同的玩家、权限组、世界等设置不同的设置。  

:warning: 我们推荐学习 LP Meta 的运作方式，这将有助于更好地使用。阅览 [LuckPerms - Prefixes, Suffixes & Meta](https://luckperms.net/wiki/Prefixes,-Suffixes-&-Meta#meta)

简言之，选项将极大提升客制化体验，它不局限于 是(true) 和 否(false)，可以是数字，也可以是字符，常被用于设置领地过期时间，税率，玩家持有领地上限等功能。

## Configuration  
选项的默认值都存储在 `options.conf`  
请查看 [*选项配置*](未实现)  

## 指令

选项支持类似于标签的指令

对领地设置 - `/claimoption <选项> <值> [情境]`  
对玩家设置 - `/cop <玩家> <选项> <值> [情境]`  
对组设置 - `/cog <权限组> <选项> <值> [情境]`  

#### 情境

所有选项适用于多个情境。   
查看 [情境](/guide/advanced/Contexts.html) 知晓更多。 

#### 示例

* 当玩家进入领地发送消息  
`/claimoption player-command-enter "/tellraw %player% [\"\",{\"text\":\"Welcome %player%!\",\"color\":\"gold\"},{\"text\":\"\\nYou are visiting %owner%s claim.\\nEnjoy your stay!\\n\\n-\"}]" run_for=member run_as=console`  
* 设置权限组 vip 的 `create-limit` (领地创建限制) 至 100，其中领地类型为基础领地。
`/cog vip create-limit 100 default=basic`  
* 设置玩家 JoeSmith's 的 `expiration` 为 30 天。  
`/cop JoeSmith expiration 30 default=basic`  
* 在该领地内禁用饱食度。
`/claimoption player-deny-hunger true`  

Note: If you get a message stating the option is not enabled, enable it under `option-control` in `options.conf`.
Note: Using `/claimoption` with no arguments opens up the GUI and displays all claim options for claim you are standing in including default options that affect all claims.  

## LuckPerms

`/lp user/group <user|group> meta set <选项> <值> [情境]`

Ex1. Set create basic claim limit of 50 for a group called `vip`  
`/lp group vip meta set griefdefender.create-limit 50 gd_claim_default=basic server=global`

Ex1. Set create basic claim limit of 50 for a group called `vip` on server mc01  
`/lp group vip meta set griefdefender.create-limit 50 gd_claim_default=basic server=mc01`

Reset all users accrued claimblocks  
`/lp bulkupdate users delete "permission ~~ meta.griefdefender\\.accrued-blocks.%"`

Reset all users bonus claimblocks  
`/lp bulkupdate users delete "permission ~~ meta.griefdefender\\.bonus-blocks.%"`  

### Useful LP DB queries  
Note: Change table prefix if not using default `luckperms`


List all user accrued blocks
```sql
SELECT B.username, REGEXP_REPLACE(A.permission, '[^0-9]+', '') FROM luckperms_user_permissions A LEFT JOIN luckperms_players B ON A.uuid=B.uuid WHERE permission LIKE '%accrued-blocks%'
```


List all user bonus blocks
```sql
SELECT B.username, REGEXP_REPLACE(A.permission, '[^0-9]+', '') FROM luckperms_user_permissions A LEFT JOIN luckperms_players B ON A.uuid=B.uuid WHERE permission LIKE '%bonus-blocks%'
```


Reset ALL user accrued blocks  
:warning:  This will wipe ALL user accrued block data. Use with caution.

```sql
DELETE FROM luckperms_user_permissions WHERE permission LIKE '%griefdefender\\\\.accrued-blocks%';
```


Reset ALL user bonus blocks  
:warning:  This will wipe ALL user bonus block data. Use with caution.

```sql
DELETE FROM luckperms_user_permissions WHERE permission LIKE '%griefdefender\\\\.bonus-blocks%';
```
